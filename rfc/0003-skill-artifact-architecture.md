## 1. Summary

This RFC proposes a **skill-first** architecture where the agent (via skills) owns end-to-end task semantics — including **context preparation** and **publishing side effects** — while Holon focuses on providing a **standard, isolated runtime** (one-shot or long-lived).

Key changes:

1. **Move context prepare into skills**: the agent can fetch/assemble required context in-container (e.g., via `gh`).
2. **Move publishing into skills**: the agent can publish via skill-provided scripts/tools (PRs/comments/messages/etc.).
3. **Artifacts are skill-defined**: Holon no longer standardizes output filenames beyond a minimal filesystem contract; “code workflow” artifacts (e.g., patches/summaries) become **recommended**, not required.
4. **Unify solve/pr-fix as a single skill** (e.g., `github-solve`) with context-aware behavior.

## 2. Motivation

### 2.1 Current Pain Points

- **Slow iteration**: today, “collect context” and “publish results” live in Holon (runner/workflows). Small behavior tweaks require changing Holon, workflows, and docs together.
- **Mode-centric coupling**: `solve` vs `pr-fix` is largely a packaging choice; behavior is driven by context (Issue vs PR) and desired side effects.
- **Rigid outputs**: standardizing artifacts at the runner level works for code review workflows, but blocks non-code skills (bots, assistants, automation) and makes new scenarios expensive to add.

### 2.2 Design Goals

- **Fast extension**: add new behaviors by shipping/updating skills (instructions + scripts), not by modifying Holon core logic.
- **Runtime neutrality**: Holon remains an engine-agnostic container runtime (Claude Code today; others later).
- **Skill-defined artifacts**: outputs are owned by the skill; Holon provides the isolated filesystem contract and execution record.
- **Supports one-shot and long-lived**: the same runtime contract works for batch “run once” and session-based “serve”.

## 4. Contract: input/workspace/output (minimal and stable)

This RFC does not redefine the agent/runner contract from RFC-0002; it clarifies the intended direction for a **skill-first** world.

### 4.1 `/holon/input` (request envelope; read-only)

- `/holon/input` contains the immutable “what to do” payload:
  - trigger payloads (issue/PR ref, webhook event, tick),
  - user message + attachments references (serve/session),
  - high-level constraints (timeouts, budgets, enabled skills).
- When context preparation is owned by skills, `/holon/input` is **not** expected to contain a fully materialized context snapshot.
- Skills MUST NOT rely on mutating `/holon/input` to pass data between steps; derived context SHOULD be written under `/holon/output` (or a skill-defined state directory).

### 4.2 `/holon/workspace` (working directory; usually read-write)

- `/holon/workspace` is the working directory for code and data.
- It can be a snapshot, a clone, or an application workspace depending on the runner/app.
- Long-lived service scenarios SHOULD isolate per-turn mutations (e.g., worktrees) to avoid cross-turn contamination.

### 4.3 `/holon/output` (skill-defined outputs; read-write)

- `/holon/output` is the only required write sink.
- Skills define their own artifact names, formats, and conventions.
- “Code workflow” skills MAY emit patches/summaries for review, but Holon should not require any specific filenames for non-code skills.

## 5. Skill design (current implementation + direction)

### 5.1 Skill naming and references

Holon supports skills as directories with `SKILL.md` and optional supporting files (scripts/templates/etc.).

Current builtin skill naming in this repository uses flat names like:
- `github-solve`

Long-term, Holon should prefer hierarchical references (platform/scenario) like:
- `github/solve`

Backward compatibility should be maintained via aliases during migration.

### 5.2 Skill staging (agent-native discovery; not prompt injection)

Holon stages resolved skills into the location discovered by the agent runtime (e.g., Claude Code).

Important:
- Holon does **not** inject skill content into compiled prompts in skill mode.
- Skills are discovered natively by the underlying engine (e.g., Claude Code skills).

### 5.3 “Unified solve” skill

The current builtin skill `github-solve` is intended to unify Issue→PR and PR-fix behavior by detecting context.

In the skill-first direction of this RFC, “context detection” can be driven by:
- request envelope fields (e.g., “issue ref” vs “pr ref”),
- or by context prepared in-container by the skill itself.

## 6. Artifact and publish model (skill-owned)

### 6.1 Artifacts are owned by the skill

This RFC deliberately avoids prescribing:
- specific artifact filenames,
- a universal artifact taxonomy,
- a universal “publisher” component in Holon.

Instead:
- each skill defines the artifacts it produces and consumes,
- each skill may include scripts/tools to enact side effects (publishing).

### 6.2 Recommended pattern: “plan as JSON, execute via script” (optional)

Many side effects (PR create/update, comments, messages) are easier to execute reliably if the agent:

1. Writes a structured JSON “intent” file (skill-defined name and schema)
2. Invokes a deterministic skill-provided script/tool to apply that intent

This pattern is:
- recommended for reliability and retryability,
- but not required by Holon.

## 7. Migration path (from runner-owned to skill-owned)

Holon already supports “skill mode” via `--skill/--skills`, but today:
- context preparation and publish are still performed by Holon commands/workflows.

The migration direction is:

1. **Skill-first GitHub flow**: move GitHub context collection and publishing into a builtin GitHub skill (or skill bundle).
2. **Thin Holon core**: Holon focuses on runtime execution and filesystem contract; app semantics live in skills.
3. **Compatibility layer**: keep `holon solve` as a convenience wrapper initially, but reduce its internal coupling over time.

## 8. Open questions

1. How should Holon represent a “request envelope” for common triggers (issue/pr refs, webhooks, ticks) without reintroducing modes?
2. How should skill references be normalized (`github-solve` vs `github/solve`) and migrated without breaking users?
3. What is the minimal always-on execution record Holon should provide (e.g., event stream/log file) while keeping artifacts skill-owned?
