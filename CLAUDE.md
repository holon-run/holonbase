# CLAUDE.md

This file is read by Claude Code and other agent tooling.

Repository-specific guidance (layout, commands, coding conventions, constraints) is maintained in `AGENTS.md` and should be treated as the source of truth.

- Read `AGENTS.md` before making changes.
- If you discover outdated guidance, update `AGENTS.md` (not this file).
- If you work in a subdirectory, also check for nested `AGENTS.md` files with more specific rules.

For deeper contributor references (debugging, contracts), see `docs/development.md`.

Additional docs (non-authoritative, deeper dives):
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/` (architecture, modes, skills, GitHub/CI integrations)
- `rfc/` (design notes and proposals)
